# Emotion Detection

This project provides a complete pipeline for emotion detection. It starts with preparing the dataset and organizing the images, followed by training a CNN model on the dataset. Finally, the trained model is deployed to perform real-time emotion detection from a webcam feed, enabling the system to recognize and display emotions in human faces.

## Introduction
Emotion Detection is a system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and recognize emotions from human faces in real-time using a webcam.

## Features
- Dataset preparation and image organization
- Training a CNN model on the dataset
- Real-time emotion detection from webcam feed

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divija444/EMOTION-DETECTION.git
